WARNING: This is primarily intended for personal use by PE within my local
copy of the repository; it is *not* a general guideline for building the
docs.

The general logic of our current approach is as follows:

A. We use Sphinx to generate pretty HTML files for the online documentation
(including auto-generation of same on readthedocs.org).



GENERAL WORKFLOW OUTLINE:

1. Update Markdown files; use BBEdit Markup->Preview to check on how it looks
while editing them.

2. Update rST files if needed: index.rst; api_ref/api_index.rst, other
api-related .rst files in that directory.

3. Generate rST versions of the Markdown files (by running convert_md_to_rst.sh
script) and test the Sphinx HTML generation by running Sphinx via the
Makefile

	$ ./convert_md_to_rst.sh && make html

View the resulting docs in a web browser pointed at
	file:///Users/erwin/coding/pyimfit_working/docs/_build/html/index.html


GETTING THIS TO WORK ON READTHEDOCS

Currently, this only partly works -- specifically, the autodoc functions fail to
bring in any of the docstring-based stuff. This is, according to the "raw" version
of the readthedocs build log (look for "v:latest" pop-up menu near bottom of
sidebar --> "On Read the Docs" --> Build; click on latest build, then click
on "View raw"), because the various import statements fail with messages like

WARNING: autodoc: failed to import module 'pyimfit.descriptions'; the following exception was raised:
No module named 'pyimfit.pyimfit_lib'

Apparently the problem is that we need to build the extension module...

We may have to generate static autodoc-equivalent .rst files instead of trying
to use the autodoc commands (the idea being that we can save these somewhere, reference
them in the *index.rst files, and let readthedocs process the .rst files)
    https://pythonhosted.org/sphinxcontrib-restbuilder/
    https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/restbuilder
    https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-restbuilder/

(Or maybe there's some way to create alternate modules that don't import pyimfit_lib?)
