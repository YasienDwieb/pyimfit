WARNING: This is primarily intended for personal use by PE within my local
copy of the repository; it is *not* a general guideline for building the
docs.

The general logic of our current approach is as follows:

A. We use Sphinx to generate pretty HTML files for the online documentation
(including auto-generation of same on readthedocs.org).



GENERAL WORKFLOW OUTLINE:

1. Update Markdown files; use BBEdit Markup->Preview to check on how it looks
while editing them.

2. Update rST files if needed: index.rst; api_ref/api_index.rst, other
api-related .rst files in that directory.

3. Generate rST versions of the Markdown files (by running convert_md_to_rst.sh
script) and test the Sphinx HTML generation by running Sphinx via the
Makefile

	$ ./convert_md_to_rst.sh && make html

View the resulting docs in a web browser pointed at
