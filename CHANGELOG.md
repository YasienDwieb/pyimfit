# Change Log for PyImfit

(Formatting and design based on Olivier Lacan's [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/))

## 0.8.6 -- 2019-08-xx
### Added
User can now specify verbosity level of fit via `verbose` keyword in Imfit.doFit().

Data, PSF, mask, and error images added to an Imfit instance are automatically processed
by the FixImage function, so it is no longer necessary to do this prior to adding them
to an Imfit instance.
